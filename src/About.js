                        <p>I am a full-stack software developer who most recently worked for a software company centered on women's health and prenatal careâ€‹. 
                        With experience in a variety of languages and frameworks, I became interested in software engineering after developing logic and critical thinking skills as a Philosophy PhD focused on topics in ethics and aesthetics.</p> 
                        <p>In other words, I could, and sometimes do, spend all day splitting strings.</p>
                        <p>In addition to being a software engineer, I am a published translator and love writing, singing and playing the guitar, biking, cooking, and gardening.</p>
