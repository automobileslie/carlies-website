                            Before I began at the Chicago Athletic Association, I was a software engineer for a company focused on women’s health and prenatal care, where I put my training in computer programming to use while honing a “how-can-I-fix-this” mentality. 
                            In another life before that, I was a Philosophy Ph.D. focusing on issues in ethics and aesthetics and teaching courses that drew on philosophy, literature, and film. 
                            All of the industries I have worked in – including food and beverage, retail, theatre, web development, and education – have helped me learn to be adaptable and resilient while shaping my communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills.
